software engineer

pursuing excellence you realize
useful is better than perfect

mastery builds over time, knowledge expands
broadens and deepens like the ocean

you are a bridge
between people and computers

people talk with color or facts
computers only understand facts
speaks both colorfully, and factually

screens are flat
software is three-dimensional
it's literally, electricity moving in the world

to understand it, zoom in and out
from bird's eye view, to godly details

reflect on the interactions
between the users, software, and engineers
then aggressively simplify

rinse and repeat
simple, down to earth, useful software
will emerge
